    NOTE: 
        sometimes velocity equation is 

            v_t = (1 - friction) * v_(t-1) + friction * grad

        but this version was used

            v_t = (1 - friction) * v_(t-1) + grad

        because it is computationally more efficient and use less memory.
        The first equation is the same as the second if the
        first equation was scaled by a factor of 1 / friction.

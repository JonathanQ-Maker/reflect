    NOTE: 
        (1) sometimes velocity equation is 

            v_t = (1 - friction) * v_(t-1) + friction * grad

        but this version was used

            v_t = (1 - friction) * v_(t-1) + grad

        because it is computationally more efficient and use less memory.
        The first equation is the same as the second if the
        first equation was scaled by a factor of 1 / friction.

        https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/25152/how-are-these-equations-of-sgd-with-momentum-equivalent

        (2) original grad_sqrd_t equation is 

            grad_sqrd_t = (1 - decay) * grad_sqrd_(t-1) + decay * grad**2

        but was reduced to 

            grad_sqrd_t = (1 - decay) * grad_sqrd_(t-1) + grad**2

        such that it is more memory efficient.
